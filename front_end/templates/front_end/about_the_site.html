          UK Box Office Analytics (UKBOA) is an interactive data visualisation tool which tracks
          the performance of films, actors, directors and screenwriters at the UK box office since 2001.
          Using the <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/education-research/film-industry-statistics-research/weekend-box-office-figures">
          BFI's weekly box office reports</a> , UKBOA gauges how films, and the people involved in 
          making them have seen their financial returns fluctuate over time, providing an insight into the
          changing tastes of British cinema-goers.
          </h3>

          <h5>
          Using a database of over 8000 films, 60,000 actors, 5000 directors and 13,000 screenwriters, UKBOA
          offers several different metrics to analyse and compare films and film-making talent.

            UKBOA presents a general overview of British cinematic revenue since the new millennium, breaking down
            the best performing titles in any given year in that time period as well as providing statistics 
            for each individual release. This includes the film's opening weekend revenue, the number of weeks it 
            appeared at the British box office (length of run), the highest rank it achieved at the box office in
            comparison to all other titles in cinemas that week, the average revenue for each cinema it appeared at
            (site average) and the film's rating on Rotten Tomatoes. If you've found yourself pondering how much money 
            Wonder Woman made for example, you can have a look its figures <a href="/film_page/tt0451279/">here</a> 
            to find it earned a respectable Â£22,183,744 and was, at it's peak, the most popular ticket in the country.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, UKBOA also breaks down films into their component parts, providing metrics to measure the 
            popularity and bankability of the actors, directors and screen writers involved in making them. By
            aggregating the data from every film that these individuals have worked on, UKBOA illustrates which 
            names have accounted for the most in box office receipts, whose films have achieved the highest average
            return, which faces have graced British cinema screens for the longest period of time and who are the  
            hard-workers that have contributed to the making the highest number of films.

            <h5>
            UKBOA draws its inspiration from <a href="https://boxoffice.rae.li/">Andy Rae's Box Office Dashboard</a> 
            which uses the BFI's weekly box office reports to track the general performance of British cinematic revenue
            since 2001 as well as the gross earnings of individual titles and distributors in that period. UKBOA uses a
            similar data pipline, extracting the relevant imformation from the BFI weekly reports, transforming and
            cleaning it before loading it into a large back-end database.
            However, where UKBOA differs is through its integration of information and images from IMDb to provide its own 
            distinct metrics and graphical interface, as well as insights into the talent involved in making the films
            included.
